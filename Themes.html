          <h4><b>Social and Cultural Background</b></h4>
          <br>
          <p>A general knowledge of the social and cultural setting in which a novel is written is important, for most novels mirror the customs and values of a particular society, often criticizing it.</p>
          <p>The neighborhood around the Bennets is large, for they dine with twenty-four different families, only three of which are named. The Bennet’s society is drawn largely from Meryton (which is the mother’s background) rather than from the country (which is the father’s), for she is more sociable than her husband. Mrs. Bennet, however, is without social ambition except for her desire to have her daughters marry rich men. Pride and Prejudice is, thus, set among the rural middle and upper classes who are landowners. None of the major characters works, for these moneyed classes live entirely on their income from rents and inheritances. There are, however, some petty distinctions discussed.</p>
          <p>Class distinctions in Jane Austen’s time were in fact very rigid. The land-owning aristocracy belonged to the highest rung of the social ladder, and all power was in their hands. Next in rank came the gentry. The new, prosperous industrialists and traders (like Mr. Gardiner) were gradually rising as a class, but had still not won the right to vote. The lowest in English society were the workers and laborers.</p>
          <p>For the women of the time, life was largely restricted to the home and the family. For the poor and the lower-class women, there was ample work in the home and in the fields to keep them busy. But for the ladies of the landed upper-classes, life was one big round of dances, dinners, cards, and visits to friends and relatives. They were not required to do any household work. "Ladies," thus, lived a life of ease and leisure, mainly concerned with society, children, and marriage. By the 19th century, the upper classes no longer arranged marriages. Instead, a girl was introduced to society (and eligible bachelors) at a reception hosted by a married woman who had herself been presented. Generally, a girl "came out" only after her elder sister was married.</p>
          <p>Women’s education in the 19th century was restricted to the daughters of a few families of the upper classes. As a result, the outside world does not play a part in Austen’s novels. Instead, she turns her attention in entirety to the things she knew: family and values. </p>

          <h1><center>Themes in Pride and Prejudice</center></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Pride and Prejudice is full of character-driven themes that revolve around the literary concept of <em>comedy of manners.</em> A comedy of manners is a literary work that deals with young lovers attempting to unite in marriage, and usually includes several incidences of witty commentary from the main characters, which can take form in terms of anything from clever flirting to open warfare, as in the case of Darcy and Elizabeth. Pride and Prejudice is mainly concerned with the pairing of several couples and the issues surrounding each of those couples</p>

            <li><a href="#Theme4">Marriage and Love</a></li>
            <li><a href="#Theme5">The Limitations of Wealth and Class<a/></li>
          </ol>
<br></br>
          <h2 id="Theme1">Pride:</h2>
          <p>One of Pride and Prejudice’s major themes includes an overabundance of pride results in arrogance. Many characters exhibit prideful behavior:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Darcy is rude and dismissive towards the Bennets and the other country residents, because he views himself as part of a superior class.</li>
              <li>Elizabeth’s pride in her intellect and judgement cause her to misjudge Darcy.</li>
              <li>Lady Catherine De Bourgh shows pride in her attempts to interfere in the match between Elizabeth and Darcy in order to uphold her family’s status.</li>
              <li>William Collins is prideful to the point that he refuses to believe that Elizabeth would truly reject him.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Elizabeth and Darcy’s case, Pride keeps the protagonists of the story from developing intimate connections. Darcy’s excessive pride causes him to behave condescendingly towards Elizabeth and her family, which inspires Elizabeth to form an unfavorable opinion of him. Elizabeth admits to Jane that she might have forgiven Darcy for his pride had he not “mortified” her own. The implication is that pride itself is not inherently bad, but in excess it results in insult and prejudice. However, even though Elizabeth condemns Darcy for his prideful behavior, she exhibits the same flaw. Her pride in her judgment renders her unwilling to revise her opinion of Darcy. It also leads her to unquestioningly believe Wickham’s lies, because they reaffirm her own beliefs. Only after Elizabeth and Darcy have been humbled by one another are they able to see the truth and make a happy marriage. Darcy still takes pride in his status, and Elizabeth still takes pride in her intelligence, but each has been tempered by humility. However, the lack of pride can also have negative results. Charlotte Lucas and Jane Bennet both dispense with pride entirely. Rather than pursuing someone who is her intellectual equal, Charlotte marries Mr. Collins in order to ensure her financial future. Though her decision is practical, it is not a choice likely to result in true marital happiness. Unlike Elizabeth, who rejected both Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy in the belief that she deserved to be happy, Charlotte settles for the first man to express interest in her. Similarly, Jane, despite being the oldest and prettiest Bennet daughter, is humble to a fault. Rather than openly displaying her regard for Mr. Bingley, she demurs. Though Jane’s humility is portrayed as a virtue, it leaves her open to rejection and ridicule. Ultimately, pride is most beneficial when it encourages people to behave responsibly and is most detrimental when it encourages prejudice or placidity.</p>
<br></br>
          <h2 id="Theme2">Prejudice:</h2>
          <p>The tendency of others to judge one another based on perceptions, rather than who they are and what they value becomes a point of prolific discussion within Pride and Prejudice. Indeed, the title of the text clearly implies the related nature of pride and prejudice as both Darcy and Elizabeth are often shown to make the wrong assumptions; Darcy’s assumptions grounded in his social prejudice whereas Elizabeth’s is rooted in her discernment led astray by her excessive pride. As Austen subtly mocks the two lovers biases, she gives the impression that while such flaws are common faulting someone else for the prejudice is easy while recognising it in yourself is hard. While Austen’s representation of prejudice is aligned with personal development and moral growth as she wittingly condemns those who refuse to set aside their prejudices like Lady Catherine and Caroline.</p>
<br></br>
          <h2 id="Theme3">Women:</h2>
          <p>Austen is certainly critical of the gender injustices present in 19th century English society, particularly as perpetrated by the institution of marriage. In Pride and Prejudice, many women (such as Charlotte) must marry solely for the sake of financial security. However, in her portrayal of Elizabeth, Austen shows that women are just as intelligent and capable as their male counterparts. Jane Austen herself went against convention by remaining single and earning a living through her novels. In her personal letters, Austen advised friends only to marry for love. In the novel, Elizabeth's happy ending reveals Austen's beliefs that woman has the right to remain independent until she meets the right man (if she meets him). On the other hand, most contemporary readers will find the Longbourn entailment to be unjust. And yet the heroines - Jane and Elizabeth - refrain from speaking out against it. Instead, the only two characters who openly criticize the entailment - Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine - are ridiculous caricatures. Furthermore, the fact that Elizabeth seems to share her father's distrust frivolous women suggests Austen's uneasy relationship with her own gender.</p>
<br></br>
          <h2 id="Theme4">Marriage and Love:</h2>
          <p>Though, marriage is the end of Jane Austen’s novel, yet it evolves more than the conclusion of a simple love story. There is a depth, variety and seriousness in Jane’s treatment of these topics. Marriage was an important social concern in Jane Austen’s time and she was fully aware of the disadvantages of remaining single. In a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, she wrote: "Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor - which is a very strong argument in favour of matrimony." The only option for unmarried woman in Jane Austen’s time was to care for someone else’s children as Jane Austen herself did; as there were no outlets for women. The novels of Jane Austen’s – especially “Pride and Prejudice” – dramatize the economic inequality of women, showing how women had to marry undesirable mates in order to gain some financial security. The theme of love and marriage is one of the major themes in “Pride and Prejudice”. Through five marriages, Jane Austen defines good and bad reasons for marriage.
            <ol>
              <li>Charlotte – Collins</li>
              <li>Lydia – Wickham</li>
              <li>Jane – Bingley</li>
              <li>Elizabeth – Darcy</li>
              <li>Mr. and Mrs. Bennet</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
<br></br>
          <h2 id="Theme5">The Limitations of Wealth and Class:</h2>
          <p>The opening line of Pride and Prejudice foregrounds the importance of wealth in the novel. Almost every character is defined by society according to their social position and annual income:
            <ul>
              <li>The Bennet daughters, who will receive very little in their inheritance, are driven by their mother to marry well.</li>
              <li>Wickham, hounded by gambling debts, is also driven to pursue women who stand to inherit good fortunes.</li>
              <li>Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley, by contrast are comfortably wealthy. For them, contrarily, their class restricts their choices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both class and wealth act as limitations on love. For the Bennet daughters, marriage must by necessity also function as a business transaction. From a practical perspective, Elizabeth’s decision to reject both Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy because her engagment could have put irreparable damage on Bennet’s family name after Lydia's elopment. on the other hand, Elizabeth's rejection to the wealthy gentlemen' highlights how arbitrary her distinctions are in the society.</p>
<br></br>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The novel has various themes according to the way various readers are able to disseminate the idea that the writer had in mind. Depending with the way the plot has been developed and the conversation that the characters have involved in, the above themes, which are love and marriage, pride, prejudice, social class, and economic inequality and reputation are the most conspicuous through the novel. They may be intertwined but excerpt have been critically examined to get the different meaning, thus diverse themes developed.</p>
