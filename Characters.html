Writers and authors use these characters to pinpoint their weaknesses and recklessness, virtues and vices and other features to make the stories impactful. Price and Prejudice have famous characters that seem relatable even in the present times. Some of these most important characters have been discussed below.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="#section1">Elizabeth Bennet</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section2">Fitzwilliam Darcy</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section3">Jane Bennet</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section4">Charles Bingley</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section5">George Wickham</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section6">Lydia Bennet</a></li>
            <li><a href="#section7">Mr. Collins</a></li>
          </ol>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section1">Elizabeth Bennet</h2>
          <p>The novel’s protagonist. The second daughter of Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth is the most intelligent and sensible of the five Bennet sisters. She is well read and quick-witted, with a tongue that occasionally proves too sharp for her own good. Her realization of Darcy’s essential goodness eventually triumphs over her initial prejudice against him.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section2">Fitzwilliam Darcy</h2>
          <p>A wealthy gentleman, the master of Pemberley, and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Though Darcy is intelligent and honest, his excess of pride causes him to look down on his social inferiors. Over the course of the novel, he tempers his class-consciousness and learns to admire and love Elizabeth for her strong character.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section3">Jane Bennet</h2>
          <p>The eldest and most beautiful Bennet sister. Jane is more reserved and gentler than Elizabeth. The easy pleasantness with which she and Bingley interact contrasts starkly with the mutual distaste that marks the encounters between Elizabeth and Darcy.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section4">Charles Bingley</h2>
          <p>Darcy’s considerably wealthy best friend. Bingley’s purchase of Netherfield, an estate near the Bennets, serves as the impetus for the novel. He is a genial, well-intentioned gentleman, whose easygoing nature contrasts with Darcy’s initially discourteous demeanor. He is blissfully uncaring about class differences.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section5">George Wickham</h2>
          <p>A handsome, fortune-hunting militia officer. Wickham’s good looks and charm attract Elizabeth initially, but Darcy’s revelation about Wickham’s disreputable past clues her in to his true nature and simultaneously draws her closer to Darcy.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section6">Lydia Bennet</h2>
          <p>The youngest Bennet sister, she is gossipy, immature, and self-involved. Unlike Elizabeth, Lydia flings herself headlong into romance and ends up running off with Wickham.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h2 id="section7">Mr. Collins</h2>
          <p>A pompous, generally idiotic clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Bennet’s property. Mr. Collins’s own social status is nothing to brag about, but he takes great pains to let everyone and anyone know that Lady Catherine de Bourgh serves as his patroness. He is the worst combination of snobbish and obsequious.</p>
